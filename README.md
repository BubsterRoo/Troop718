# Troop 718
The unofficial website for my BSA Troop, Troop 718 in North Florida Council.

This website tells you a little about our Troop and what we do, and allows you information if you wanted the opportunity to join the Troop.
It has many different tabs to let you see information for not only our Troop, but also Boy Scout related information.

**You can see an about us page, the meeting information, along with our calendar, the merit badge page
that links to the official Scouting.org webpage for it, Rank pages each with individual pages for the requirements,
a couple recipies you can enjoy on a camping trip, an email page that links to the page in Scoutbook, and finally
the Be A Scout page that lets you join our Troop with more information about us.**

On the page, there is also the Scouting Values, along with the Scouting 10 Essentials along with links to the respective topic page.
In the future, I plan to add a Helpful Links section for easier use.
