                    Troop 718 is a largely scout led troop -
                    meaning that the scouts plan activities,
                    lead meetings, and help each other with advancements.
                    We participates in an outdoor, overnight activity at least once a month,
                    including camping, hiking, canoeing, volunteering, and visiting ranges.
                    Every summer, scouts are able to attend a Summer Camp where
                    they can attend many different Merit Badge classes for more
                    oppurtunities to get Merit Badges.
                    As a Scout, one must know the Scout Oath, Scout Law, and Outdoor Code.
