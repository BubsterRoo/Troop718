                    The Life Rank is one of the rarest ranks. This is the last rank before Eagle. You could
                    complete your Eagle Rank now in as few as 6 months. We congratulate you and
                    encourage you to reach for that next step. You have earned more than half of the merit
                    badges required for Eagle. The Life Rank also requires the Scout to be active in his troop
                    for at least six months, serve his troop in a position of leadership for at least six months,
                    and take part in at least one service project.
