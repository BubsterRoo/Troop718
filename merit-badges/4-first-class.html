                    The founder of Scouting, Lord Baden Powell, said that all Scouts should earn First Class.
                    Now you have tested yourself even more. You have tried greater adventures and
                    practiced your Scout skills many times. With your confidence and knowledge you now
                    have, people will expect more of you, and you will expect more of yourself. You are
                    prepared to be more of a leader in your patrol, your troop, and your community.
