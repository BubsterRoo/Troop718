                    As you earn your Star Rank, you have more freedom to choose the directions that
                    interest you. The focus shifts from basic Scout skills to earning the first six merit badges
                    you will need for Eagle. Requirements now include service to others. The Star Rank also
                    requires the Scout to be active in his troop for at least four months. Of course, you may
                    take longer if you wish. In addition, the Star Scout must serve his troop in a position of
                    leadership for at least four months and take part in at least one service project.
