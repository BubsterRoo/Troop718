                    The Eagle Rank is Scouting's highest award. Only a small percentage of Scouts have
                    ever reached this lofty goal. The Eagle Rank is presented in a special Eagle Scout Court
                    of Honor. After earning the rank of Eagle Scout, there are Eagle Palms which can be
                    awarded for continuing to be an active member of the troop and earning additional
                    merit badges.
