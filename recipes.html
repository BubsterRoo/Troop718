                    Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals.
                    Place a grate over the fire.
                    <div class = "blank">⠀</div>
                    <span class = "step">Step 2.</span>
                    Place a 12-inch cast iron Dutch oven onto the grate.
                    Add sausage, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
                    Stir in hash browns and bell peppers until well mixed.
                    Cook, stirring occasionally, until hash browns are hot and peppers are tender, about 15 minutes.
                    <div class = "blank">⠀</div>
                    <span class = "step">Step 3.</span>
                    Pour beaten eggs into the Dutch oven, allowing them to seep down to the bottom.
                    Cover the Dutch oven and place it directly onto 5 to 10 hot coals.
                    Place another 12 to 18 hot coals on top of the Dutch oven lid.
                    Let cook until eggs are firm, about 40 minutes.
                    Open the lid and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
                    Cover and continue to cook until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.

                    Snip one top and one bottom corner off each bag, then cut open along the side edge.
                    Spoon equal amounts of beef, lettuce, Cheddar, tomato, sour cream,
                    and salsa into each bag on top of crushed chips.
